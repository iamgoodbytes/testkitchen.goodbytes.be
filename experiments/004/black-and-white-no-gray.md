This is the entry I made for Genuary 2024, day 14. "Pure black and white. No Gray" was the prompt a lot of generative artists followed that day. Genuary is an awesome initiative that challenges artists to create a generative art piece every day.

For me these kinds of small experiments free me from the pressure of creating something big and polished. I can just play around with ideas and see where they take me. Check out [Genuary](https://genuary.art/)
