I have a love for weird, abstract and colorful visuals. I tend to gravitate towards color palettes that are reminiscent of the 90s, often with a neon twist.

An artist I look up to is [Kris Andrew Small](https://krisandrewsmall.com/), who has a unique style that I admire. After seeing a pattern on a design he did for cycling brand GRC, I was tempted to recreate a similar effect using TSL (Three Shader Language). This gave me the opportunity to practice my TSL and shader skills, while creating something visually appealing.

It shouldn't have been a surprise, but still I was shocked to hear a friend who didn't know what the book 1984 was about. He's one of my best friends who's also keen on installing privacy-invading things like the Amazon Ring. This triggered me to create a demo that has some subliminal messages in it like "Read books". 

The demo allows you to click on the cans and make dents in them. I hope someone picks up a book (preferably 1984) after seeing this demo.

The style and inspiration should be attributed to Kris Andrew Small, and the demo is a tribute to his work.
