It's your face on a can! Open up the webcam and start hitting the can as hard as you can. 

This is a ridiculous demo that could be used as an idea for a marketing campaign. I've just pitched a similar idea to a marketing agency that works for Lay's, who seemed kind of intrigued. More on that later :p

I guess that's why I like creating these otherwise useless experiments, they always tend to evolve into something more interesting later down the line.

The demo allows you to click on the can and make dents in it. Curious to see your results!
