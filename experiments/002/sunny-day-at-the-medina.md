Sunny day at the medina is a continuation of my exploration of the vibrant and bustling streets of Morocco. This time, I wanted to capture the feeling of a sunny day in the medina, with the sun shining down and casting long shadows across the streets.

The colors are bright and warm, and the air is filled with the sounds of people going about their daily lives. I hope this experiment captures some of the energy and beauty of this amazing place.
