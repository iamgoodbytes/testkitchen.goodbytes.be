In order to learn more about TSL (Three Shader Langer) I built a pretty simple demo that has a shader running on several boxes. 

Once applied, I wanted to make it feel more like some kind of a festival website demo or visual. 

For reasons unknown to me or simply because I grew up back then, I tend to gravitate to color palettes that are reminiscent of the 90s and often contain lots of neon.
