"Bullet time museum" is a shader experiment that explores the concept of bullet time, a visual effect popularized by films like "The Matrix."

The first time I encountered this effect must have been in Max Payne (2001), where the gameplay slowed down during intense moments, allowing players to dodge bullets in slow motion.

In this demo, I'm slowing down movement and audio when the user holds down the mouse. At the same time, I'm applying a shader with a distortion effect, amplyfying the bullet time experience.
