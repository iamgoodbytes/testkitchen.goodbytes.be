We are all on this planet for a short ride. Time flows in one direction, and we are carried along with it. In this experiment, I wanted to visualize the passage of time somehow. 

There's a few things that make me think about time. The cells in your body are constantly being replaced and after 7 to 10 years, you have a completely new body. Still, you are the same person or are you? 

In 100 years, none of the people alive today will be around anymore. The world will be a completely different place. That's both a frightening and sobering thought.

"Time is what we want most, but what we use worst." - William Penn
