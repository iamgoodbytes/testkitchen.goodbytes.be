Marrakesh Mirage is a shader experiment that draws inspiration from the vibrant colors and intricate patterns of Marrakesh, Morocco. The project is a visual representation of the city's rich culture and architecture, translated into a subtle and vibrant shader.

I'm super happy that this shader was selected for the 2025 mowa Biennial running from May 1 to September 28, 2025, at the [Museum of Wild and Newfangled Art](https://mowna.org).
