Here are two of my favourite artists combined in one experiment: Victor Vasarely and Mitsuo Katsui.

Katsui inspires me because of his use of vibrant colours and abstract forms, while Vasarely is the father of Op Art, known for his geometric patterns and optical illusions.

In this experiment I tried recreating some of Vasarely's iconic patterns using shaders, while incorporating Katsui's vibrant colour palette. Technically, I wanted to experiment writing TSL shaders from scratch in order to better understand how they work.
