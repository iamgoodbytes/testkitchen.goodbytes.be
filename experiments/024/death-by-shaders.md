In order to explore the retro-look of low-resolution graphics, I created "death by shaders," an experiment that leverages shaders to produce a pixelated aesthetic.
The goal was to see how custom dithering and pixelation effects could be achieved using shaders within a Three.js framework.

In a future version I might make this respond to sound, but for now, it's a static demo that showcases the visual style I was aiming for. Enjoy the early 90s vibes.
