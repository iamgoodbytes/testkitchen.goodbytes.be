One of my earlier attempts at setting up a 3D model in threejs and adding a shader to mimic a drink activation campaign. Original inspiration came from the epic [Slosh Seltzer campaign](https://sloshseltzer.com/).

Give it a try by clicking somewhere on the screen in the demo to see the effect. The shader is a simple liquid shader based on the ray marching technique and signed distance functions (SDF). Learn more about ray marching [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_marching).
