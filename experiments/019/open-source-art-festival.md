When I stumbled upon a static image on Instagram promoting the Open Source Art Festival, I immediately thought it would be fun to create an interactive version of it.

This simple demo was an exercise in recreating the original circular design using only code with TSL shaders, while adding interactivity by making the shapes respond to mouse movements.

Pairs well with Loscil's music.
