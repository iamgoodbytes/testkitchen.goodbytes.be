Nucleus is a shader experiment that pays homage to the work of Olafur Eliasson, a renowned artist known for his immersive installations and exploration of light, color, and perception. The project draws inspiration from Eliasson's use of light and color to create captivating experiences that challenge our understanding of the world around us.

Human connection is what makes life special, yet modern times often seem to divide us. This little webpage is my tiny attempt at evoking a sense of connectedness, no matter the physical distance between us. It's a visual representation of my search to bring people closer together. 

Inspiration actually came from my recent visit to Studio Olafur Eliasson where I had the chance to be involved in one of their projects called Little Sun. I was captivated by the way they use food to connect the whole team and create a sense of community.
