Inspired by [Absolute Territory by Prismbeings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9r8pxIogxZ0) I decided to create a similar atmosphere in a couple of hours by combining shaders, three.js and some music.

Cameras can be controlled by using number 1, 2, 3 and so on. For me, the demo is a quick experiment to see how I can create a certain mood by controlling cameras, reflection, and lighting.
