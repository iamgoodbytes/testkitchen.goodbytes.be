A recent trip to the medina's of Morocco has inspired this little shader experiment. The Medina is a vibrant and bustling place, full of life and energy.

The streets are lined with shops selling everything from spices to carpets, and the air is filled with the sounds of people going about their daily lives. This experiment aims to capture some of that energy and bring it to life in a digital form.
