A tribute to Mitsuo Katsui, a pioneering Japanese designer known for his vibrant and futuristic aesthetics in the 1980s. His work often featured bold colors, geometric shapes, and a sense of motion that captured the spirit of the era.

He is perhaps my most significant influence when it comes to color and design, and his work continues to inspire me to this day.

This tiny one page demo is my way of honoring his legacy. It took me around 20 hours to complete and was a labor of love. The shader is custom built to mimic some of his signature styles, and I hope it captures a bit of the magic that made his work so special. The audio effect was also custom made in code. Postprocessing was used to create the afterimage effect on the glass shape.

The video was created with the help of AI based on one of his portraits. The music I selected to match this demo is a track from the album Gravity Pairs by Beacon. Their cover art and overall aesthetic has been an inspiration for them, just as it has been for me.
