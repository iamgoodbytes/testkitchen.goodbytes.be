This is the entry I made for Genuary 2024, day 17. "What if pi equals four" was the prompt that triggered this demo. 

For me these kinds of small experiments free me from the pressure of creating something big and polished. I can just play around with ideas and see where they take me. Check out [Genuary](https://genuary.art/) for more info.
