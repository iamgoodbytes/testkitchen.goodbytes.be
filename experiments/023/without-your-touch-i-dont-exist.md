If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound? Without your touch, I don't exist is a play on that philosophical question.

In this experiment, I wanted to explore the idea of existence being tied to perception. The visual elements only come to life when interacted with, suggesting that without engagement, they remain dormant.

Other than than that, it just makes for a fun interaction. Give it a try!
